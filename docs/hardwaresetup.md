# Recommended Hardware Setup for the Rosie Repository

The purpose of the Rosie repository is to serve as the primary data storage and vizualization system for your smart home.

The recommended harware setup for the repository is the following:

- Raspberry Pi 3 (or Raspberry Pi 2 with a Wifi dongle)
- 64+ GB SD Card (Type 10)

A larger card will be needed to ensure that the repository can log enough history and host Grafana dashboards.

You can try other boards, but none have been tested at this point, and the software setup assumes a system running Debian Linux.
